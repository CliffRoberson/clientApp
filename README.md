How to use the tictactoe client:

Upon starting the app one will be prompted for the server's IP (no port required). Type that in and press OK. From there press New Game and a "waiting for match" screen will appear. When another player requests a match, the game will begin. One user's (player 1) buttons will become active and that player makes the first move. After the first move is made, the other player's buttons are activated. Player 1's buttons are reactivated after player 2 has made a move. After the game is over, to look for another match press New Game again.
